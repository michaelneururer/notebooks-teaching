These are notebooks that I wrote (sometimes with collaborators) for courses that I taught. They are written either in Python or in the (Python-based) computer algebra system SageMath. Currently included are the courses:

1. L-functions and applications, a course that I taught jointly with Jolanta Marzec at Masters level. Several exercise sheets were accompanied by Sage worksheets. For the full course material including lecture notes and exercise sheets check [my website](https://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb/personal/details/michael_neururer.en.jsp).
2. Cryptography, a course taught jointly with R\'ois\'in Neururer at the summer school 'Faszination Mathematik' for pupils aged 16-18. The aim of the course was to program an RSA cryptosystem from scratch in Python. The group of 8 pupils succeded in doing that and gave a presentation at the end of the week.
